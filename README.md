  ## Description
  In this project, I created a back end for an e-commerce site.  This project uses Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.  
  ## Installation
  After cloning the repository, install Express.js along with MySQL2 and Sequelize by running npm install express sequelize mysql2.  This connects Express.js to the MySQL database.  Next install dotenv by running npm i dotenv in the terminal.  This is an environmental variable file to store sensitive data.
  ## Usage
  To run the project you must first enter npm run seed in the terminal to seed the database, then run npm start to start the server.  This project allows you to view, add, edit and delete catagories, products and tags.
